### **Energy-Efficient Scheduling for IoT Networks**

### Problem Description:

IoT devices operate on battery power, making energy-efficient scheduling essential to prolong network lifetime. The goal is to minimize energy consumption while ensuring reliable data transmission.

**Objective:** Minimize total energy consumption while meeting delay constraints.

**Constraints:**

1. Each IoT device must transmit its data within a predefined time window.
2. The transmission power of each device must be optimized to balance energy use and reliability.
3. The total energy consumed must remain within the networkâ€™s energy budget.

### Variable Parameters:

- Number of IoT devices: 50
- Maximum transmission power per device: 10 dBm
- Network energy budget: 1000 mJ
- Maximum latency per transmission: 50 ms
