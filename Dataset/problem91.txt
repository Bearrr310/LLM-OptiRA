### **Energy-Efficient Joint Beamforming and Power Allocation**

### Problem Description:

Beamforming can enhance communication performance, but it also increases power consumption. The challenge is to balance energy efficiency and performance.

**Objective:** Minimize the total power consumption while ensuring a target SINR for all users.

**Constraints:**

1. The total beamforming power must not exceed a predefined limit.
2. The SINR at each user must be greater than a threshold.
3. The beamforming weight vectors must satisfy unit modulus constraints.

### Variable Parameters:

- Number of users: 8
- Number of antennas per base station: 16
- Maximum total power budget: 30 dBm
- Minimum SINR per user: 10 dB
