### **Optimal Power Control for Device-to-Device (D2D) Communication**

### Problem Description:

D2D communication allows devices to communicate directly without a base station. The challenge is to allocate power efficiently while minimizing interference to cellular users.

**Objective:** Maximize the sum rate of D2D pairs while keeping interference below a predefined limit.

**Constraints:**

1. The interference caused to cellular users must not exceed a threshold.
2. The power allocated to each D2D pair must not exceed its maximum limit.
3. Each D2D pair must achieve a minimum rate to maintain communication quality.

### Variable Parameters:

- Number of D2D pairs: 5
- Maximum transmit power per D2D pair: 18 dBm
- Maximum interference threshold to cellular users: -95 dBm
- Minimum rate per D2D pair: 3 Mbps
