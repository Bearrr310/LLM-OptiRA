### **UAV-Assisted IoT Network Optimization**

### **Problem Description:**

UAVs can be deployed to assist IoT devices in remote areas by acting as relays. The goal is to optimize UAV placement.

**Objective:** Minimize the total transmission delay while ensuring all IoT devices are connected.

**Constraints:**

1. Each UAV must remain within a specific altitude range.
2. The total number of UAVs must be minimized.

**Variable Parameters:**

- Number of IoT devices: 50
- Number of UAVs: 5
- UAV altitude range: 100m - 500m
- Maximum transmission delay: 10 ms
