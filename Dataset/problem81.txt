### **Optimized Trajectory Design for UAV-Assisted IoT Networks**

### Problem Description:

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are used to provide connectivity for IoT devices in remote areas. The challenge is to design the UAVâ€™s trajectory while ensuring efficient data collection.

**Objective:** Minimize the total flight energy consumption while ensuring all IoT devices receive service.

**Constraints:**

1. Each IoT device must be visited by at least one UAV within a given time.
2. The total flight time of each UAV must not exceed its battery capacity.
3. The communication link quality between UAVs and IoT devices must meet a minimum SINR.

### Variable Parameters:

- Number of UAVs: 3
- Number of IoT devices: 20
- Maximum UAV flight time: 60 minutes
- Minimum SINR requirement for IoT devices: 8 dB
