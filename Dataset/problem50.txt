### ** Power Allocation with Exponential QoS Penalty**

**Problem Description**  
In a V2V safety-critical application, QoS violations incur exponential penalties in utility. The optimization seeks to allocate power to minimize the total expected penalty, which is modeled as \( \sum_i \exp(-\alpha_i \cdot R_i) \), where \(R_i\) is user i's rate. This objective is **non-convex due to the exponential rate transformation**.

**Variable Parameters**  
1. **Number of Vehicles**: 4  
2. **Max Transmit Power per Vehicle**: 8 W  
3. **\(\alpha\) Parameters**: [2.0, 1.5, 2.2, 1.8]  
4. **Channel Gains**: [0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 0.6]  
5. **Bandwidth**: 1 MHz  
6. **Noise Power**: \(1e-9\) W
