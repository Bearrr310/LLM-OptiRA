### **Adaptive Resource Allocation in Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) Networks**

### Problem Description:

ISAC networks integrate wireless communication and radar sensing to enable joint operation. The challenge is to dynamically allocate spectrum and power between sensing and communication tasks to balance performance.

**Objective:** Maximize communication throughput while maintaining sufficient sensing accuracy.

**Constraints:**

1. The allocated bandwidth for sensing and communication must not exceed the total available spectrum.
2. The transmit power for sensing must ensure a minimum radar detection probability.
3. Each communication user must achieve a minimum required SINR.

### Variable Parameters:

- Total available bandwidth: 100 MHz
- Number of users: 10
- Minimum SINR for communication: 15 dB
- Sensing power requirement: -50 dBm for target detection
- Spectrum division: Flexible between sensing and communication
