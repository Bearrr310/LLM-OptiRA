### **Latency-Constrained Resource Allocation in URLLC Systems**

### Problem Description:

Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC) is essential for applications like autonomous driving and industrial automation. The challenge is to allocate resources to minimize latency while ensuring reliability.

**Objective:** Minimize end-to-end latency while guaranteeing a target packet error rate.

**Constraints:**

1. The allocated bandwidth must be sufficient to meet latency requirements.
2. Each user must achieve a packet error rate below the reliability threshold.
3. The total system bandwidth must not exceed the available spectrum.

### Variable Parameters:

- Number of URLLC users: 10
- Total available bandwidth: 20 MHz
- Maximum latency per user: 1 ms
- Packet error rate threshold:10^{-5}
- Minimum data rate per URLLC user: 2 Mbps
