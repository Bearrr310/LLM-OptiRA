### **Distributed Power Control in D2D Communication Networks**

### Problem Description:

Device-to-Device (D2D) communication allows users to communicate directly without routing through a base station. The challenge is to optimize power control to maximize network efficiency while minimizing interference.

**Objective:** Maximize the sum rate of all D2D pairs while keeping interference to cellular users below a threshold.

**Constraints:**

1. The total transmit power per D2D device must not exceed a given limit.
2. The interference to nearby cellular users must remain below a predefined threshold.
3. Each D2D link must maintain a minimum SINR for reliable transmission.

### Variable Parameters:

- Number of D2D pairs: 6
- Maximum transmit power per D2D device: 15 dBm
- Interference threshold to cellular users: -100 dBm
- Minimum SINR per D2D pair: 7 dB
