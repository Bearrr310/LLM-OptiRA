### **Rate Maximization in NOMA-Based 5G Networks**

### Problem Description:

Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) enables multiple users to share the same frequency resources by employing power-domain multiplexing. The challenge is to allocate power efficiently to maximize the sum rate while ensuring fairness among users.

**Objective:** Maximize the total network sum rate while maintaining fairness in power allocation.

**Constraints:**

1. The sum power of all NOMA users must not exceed the base stationâ€™s total power budget.
2. Users with weaker channels must receive higher power to ensure fairness.
3. Each user must achieve a minimum SINR requirement for successful decoding.

### Variable Parameters:

- Number of NOMA users: 8
- Maximum base station power: 30 dBm
- Minimum SINR per user: 10 dB
- Power allocation fairness factor: 0.2 (ensuring weaker users receive sufficient power)
