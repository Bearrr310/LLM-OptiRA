### **Energy-Efficient Hybrid Beamforming in mmWave MIMO Systems**

### Problem Description:

Millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO systems require hybrid beamforming to reduce hardware complexity. The challenge is to optimize digital and analog beamforming weights while minimizing power consumption.

**Objective:** Maximize the spectral efficiency while minimizing power consumption.

**Constraints:**

1. The sum power of all RF chains must not exceed a given power budget.
2. The beamforming vectors must satisfy unit modulus constraints.
3. Each user must receive a minimum SINR to ensure reliable communication.

### Variable Parameters:

- Number of users: 10
- Number of RF chains per base station: 4
- Maximum power budget per RF chain: 18 dBm
- Minimum SINR per user: 9 dB
