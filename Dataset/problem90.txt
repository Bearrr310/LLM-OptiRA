### **Uplink Scheduling for Massive MIMO Systems**

### Problem Description:

Massive MIMO systems enable multiple users to transmit simultaneously using a large antenna array. The challenge is to optimize the uplink scheduling strategy.

**Objective:** Maximize the network throughput while ensuring fairness in resource allocation.

**Constraints:**

1. Each user can be scheduled on only one time slot.
2. The total power consumption of all users must not exceed a given limit.
3. The received SINR at the base station must meet a predefined threshold.

### Variable Parameters:

- Number of users: 15
- Number of base station antennas: 64
- Maximum transmit power per user: 20 dBm
- Minimum SINR requirement: 12 dB
