### **UAV-Assisted Relay Network for Rural Coverage**

### Problem Description:

In remote areas, UAVs can act as relays to extend coverage where terrestrial networks are unavailable. The challenge is to optimize UAV deployment and power control.

**Objective:** Maximize coverage area while minimizing UAV energy consumption.

**Constraints:**

1. Each UAV’s altitude must be optimized to balance coverage and interference.
2. The relay power must be managed to maintain connectivity without excessive interference.
3. The UAV’s total flight time must not exceed its battery capacity.

### Variable Parameters:

- Number of UAVs: 2
- UAV altitude range: 100m - 500m
- Maximum UAV transmit power: 20 dBm
- Maximum UAV flight time: 2 hours
