### Bandwidth Allocation Optimization Problem

**Problem Description**

In a multi-user OFDM system, the objective is to allocate bandwidth to each user to maximize the total throughput of the system while ensuring efficient use of available resources. Each user can be allocated a specific portion of the total bandwidth, and their transmission rate depends on the allocated bandwidth and power.

The optimization problem aims to maximize the sum of the rates for all users while satisfying constraints on total bandwidth, individual bandwidth limits, and minimum service quality thresholds. The transmission rate for each user can be expressed as:
\[
R_i = B_i \cdot \log_2\left(1 + \text{SNR}_i\right)
\]

### Variable Parameters

1. **Number of Users**: 6
2. **Total Bandwidth**: 60 MHz
3. **Maximum Bandwidth per User**: 10 MHz
4. **Channel Gain Formula**: Using a path loss model, the channel gain is set as:
\[
|h_i|^2 = \frac{1}{(d_i)^2} \quad (d_i = 500\, \text{m})
\]
5. **Noise Power Density**: \(N_0 = 1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{W/Hz}\)
6. **Minimum Service Rate**: 1 Mbps
