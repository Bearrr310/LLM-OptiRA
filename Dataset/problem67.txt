### **Interference-Aware Power Control in Device-to-Device (D2D) Networks**

### Problem Description:

Device-to-Device (D2D) communication allows direct communication between devices without routing through a base station. The goal is to optimize power control to maximize system throughput while minimizing interference to cellular users.

**Objective:** Maximize the sum rate of D2D pairs while ensuring minimal interference to cellular users.

**Constraints:**

1. The interference from D2D users to cellular users must not exceed a predefined threshold.
2. The total transmit power of all D2D pairs must remain within a given budget.
3. Each D2D link must maintain a minimum SINR for successful communication.

### Variable Parameters:

- Number of D2D pairs: 6
- Maximum D2D transmit power: 20 dBm
- Maximum interference threshold for cellular users: -100 dBm
- Minimum SINR per D2D link: 10 dB
