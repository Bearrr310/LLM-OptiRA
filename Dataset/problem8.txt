### Power Allocation Optimization Problem

**Problem Description**

In a multi-user OFDM communication system, the objective is to maximize the total throughput of the system by optimizing the power allocation for each user. The throughput for each user is influenced by the power they allocate and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) achieved through the corresponding channel. The channel is affected by interference from other users and environmental conditions.

The optimization problem aims to maximize the sum of the SNRs for all users, which can be calculated using the following formula:
\[
\text{SNR}_i = \frac{P_i \cdot |h_i|^2}{N_0 \cdot B}
\]
where:

- \(P_i\) is the power allocated to user \(i\)
- \(|h_i|^2\) is the channel gain for user \(i\)
- \(N_0\) is the noise power density
- \(B\) is the bandwidth

Constraints include the maximum transmit power for each user, the total power budget across all users, and minimum quality of service requirements.

### Variable Parameters

1. **Number of Users**: 6
2. **Maximum Power per User**: 20 Watts
3. **Total Power Budget**: 80 Watts
4. **Channel Gain Formula**: Using a path loss model, assuming the distance \(d_i\) (in meters) from each user to the base station is:
\[
|h_i|^2 = \frac{1}{(d_i)^2} \quad (d_i = 500\, \text{m})
\]
Thus, \(|h_i|^2 = \frac{1}{500^2} = 0.00004\)
5. **Noise Power Density**: \(N_0 = 1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{W/Hz}\)
6. **Minimum Service Rate**: 1 Mbps
