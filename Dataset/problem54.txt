### **Proportional Fairness in Uplink Power Allocation**

**Problem Description**  
In a multi-user uplink scenario, each user transmits to a common base station over orthogonal channels. The goal is to maximize proportional fairness among users by maximizing the **sum of logarithms** of achievable rates. Each user's achievable rate is a logarithmic function of SINR, which is itself a non-convex function of transmit power. Power budget per user and minimum throughput constraints must be met.

**Variable Parameters**  
1. **Number of Users**: 4  
2. **Bandwidth per User**: 1 MHz  
3. **Channel Gain per User**: [0.5, 0.8, 0.6, 0.9]  
4. **Noise Power**: \(1 \times 10^{-10}\) Watts  
5. **Max Power per User**: 10 Watts  
6. **Minimum Rate per User**: 0.5 Mbps  
7. **Objective Function**: \(\sum_{i=1}^4 \log_2(R_i)\)
