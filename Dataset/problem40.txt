### **Coverage Maximization in Heterogeneous Networks**

**Problem Description**

In a heterogeneous network consisting of macro and small cells, the objective is to maximize the total coverage area by optimally turning on/off small cells and allocating power to each active cell. The coverage is defined as the total area where the received SINR exceeds a threshold. The optimization is subject to power budget constraints, backhaul capacity limits, and a maximum number of simultaneously active small cells. Users are uniformly distributed across the coverage area.

**Variable Parameters**

1. **Number of Small Cells**: 6
2. **Number of Macro Cells**: 1
3. **Maximum Power per Small Cell**: 10 Watts
4. **Maximum Power for Macro Cell**: 40 Watts
5. **SINR Threshold for Coverage**: 5 dB
6. **Maximum Active Small Cells**: 4
7. **Backhaul Capacity per Small Cell**: 20 Mbps
