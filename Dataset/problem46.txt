### **Joint Frequency and Trajectory Planning for UAV Swarms**

**Problem Description**  
A swarm of UAVs must deliver data to ground terminals while avoiding mutual interference. Each UAV chooses a trajectory and a frequency subband. The objective is to maximize total delivery rate while maintaining a **minimum distance between UAVs**, introducing a **non-convex quadratic distance constraint** between trajectories.

**Variable Parameters**  
1. **Number of UAVs**: 3  
2. **Flight Time**: 30 seconds  
3. **Subbands Available**: 5  
4. **Min UAV Distance Constraint**: â‰¥ 20 meters  
5. **Transmit Power per UAV**: 5 W  
6. **Channel Model**: LoS with elevation angle loss
