**Joint User Scheduling and Resource Allocation in Full-Duplex Networks**

### Problem Description:

Full-duplex (FD) communication enables simultaneous transmission and reception, increasing spectrum efficiency. However, self-interference and inter-user interference must be carefully managed through optimal scheduling and resource allocation.

**Objective:** Maximize system spectral efficiency while mitigating self-interference.

**Constraints:**

1. The total self-interference power must remain below a predefined threshold.
2. The sum of allocated resources per user must not exceed the total system bandwidth.
3. Each scheduled user must meet a minimum required SINR.

### Variable Parameters:

- Number of users: 12
- System bandwidth: 100 MHz
- Maximum self-interference power: -80 dBm
- Minimum required SINR per user: 14 dB
- Full-duplex efficiency factor: 0.85 (accounts for practical hardware imperfections)
