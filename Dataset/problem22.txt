### **Hybrid Satellite-Terrestrial Network Resource Allocation**

### **Problem Description:**

Satellite-terrestrial networks use both satellite and terrestrial base stations to provide coverage. The challenge is to allocate spectrum efficiently.

**Objective:** Maximize the total system throughput while avoiding interference.

**Constraints:**

1. The spectrum allocated to satellite and terrestrial users must be balanced.
2. The interference between satellite and terrestrial links must be below a threshold.

**Variable Parameters:**

- Number of terrestrial base stations: 8
- Number of satellite beams: 4
- Total available spectrum: 200 MHz
- Maximum interference threshold: -90 dBm
