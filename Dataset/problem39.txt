**Max-Min Fairness Beamforming in Multi-User MISO Downlink**

**Problem Description**  
A base station equipped with multiple antennas serves multiple single-antenna users using beamforming in a downlink multiple-input single-output (MISO) system. The aim is to maximize the minimum received SINR among all users (max-min fairness), ensuring uniform quality of service. Each user experiences interference from other beams. The optimization involves selecting complex beamforming vectors under a total transmit power constraint and individual SINR thresholds.
