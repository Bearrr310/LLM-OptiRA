### Problem Description
In a satellite communication system, the goal is to maximize the overall network capacity by jointly optimizing beam allocation and power distribution among users. Each user can be assigned a specific beam, and the capacity of their transmission is influenced by both the power allocated and the channel conditions. The channel gain between the user and the satellite is modeled using a path loss formula, where the gain is inversely proportional to the distance raised to a power coefficient, reflecting the effects of environmental factors.
The optimization problem consists of maximizing the sum of the logarithm of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for each user. The SINR is determined by the allocated power and the interference from other users sharing the beams. Constraints include ensuring that each beam can only be assigned to one user, limiting the maximum power for each user, adhering to a total power budget for the satellite, and keeping interference levels within a specified threshold.

### Variable Parameters

1. **Number of Users**: The system supports exactly 30 users, providing a balance between capacity and complexity.
2. **Maximum Power per User**: Each user can be allocated a maximum transmit power of 5 watts, accommodating various user equipment capabilities.
3. **Total Power Budget**: The total power available for the satellite is set at 150 watts, allowing efficient energy distribution among users.
4. **Interference Threshold**: The maximum allowable interference for each user is capped at 0.5 watts, ensuring reliable communication without excessive disruption.
5. **Channel Gain Calculation**: The channel gain for each user is determined using the formula \( |h_{ij}|^2 = \frac{K}{d_{ij}^\alpha} \), where \( K \) is a constant reflecting environmental factors, \( d_{ij} \) is the distance from the user to the satellite, and \( \alpha \) is a path loss exponent set to 2, indicating a free-space environment.
