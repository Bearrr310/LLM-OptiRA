### **Cell-Free Massive MIMO Power Allocation**

### **Problem Description:**

In cell-free massive MIMO networks, users are served by multiple access points (APs) without predefined cell boundaries. The goal is to allocate power optimally to enhance performance.

**Objective:** Maximize the sum rate of all users while ensuring fairness.

**Constraints:**

1. The total power allocated to each AP must not exceed its power budget.
2. Each user must receive a minimum SINR.

**Variable Parameters:**

- Number of APs: 10
- Number of users: 20
- Maximum transmit power per AP: 30 dBm
- Minimum SINR per user: 10 dB
