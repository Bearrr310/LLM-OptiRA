### **Joint Task Offloading and Resource Allocation in Mobile Edge Computing (MEC)**

### Problem Description:

MEC enables task offloading to nearby servers to reduce mobile device computation load. The challenge is to determine optimal offloading decisions.

**Objective:** Minimize the total task execution delay while ensuring energy efficiency.

**Constraints:**

1. Each task must be offloaded to only one MEC server.
2. The total computational capacity of each server must not be exceeded.
3. Offloading decisions must minimize overall network energy consumption.

### Variable Parameters:

- Number of mobile devices: 12
- Number of MEC servers: 3
- Maximum computational capacity per server: 100 GHz
- Maximum energy consumption per task: 5 Joules
