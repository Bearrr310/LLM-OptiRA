### **Latency-Aware Resource Allocation for 6G Networks**

### Problem Description:

6G networks will require ultra-low latency for applications like autonomous driving and AR/VR. The challenge is to allocate resources dynamically while maintaining latency requirements.

**Objective:** Minimize latency while maximizing system throughput.

**Constraints:**

1. Each user’s end-to-end delay must not exceed a predefined threshold.
2. The total bandwidth allocated must remain within the network’s capacity.
3. The scheduling delay must be optimized to reduce queuing times.

### Variable Parameters:

- Number of users: 20
- Total available bandwidth: 100 MHz
- Maximum latency per user: 1 ms
- Minimum data rate per user: 10 Mbps
