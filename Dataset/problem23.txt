### Problem Description for Optimization Problem 1: Minimizing Signal Distortion
In this optimization problem, the objective is to minimize the distortion of a WLAN S1G waveform after transmission through a TGah SISO channel, characterized by its inherent noise and path loss. The signal distortion is evaluated using the mean squared error between the received signal and the transmitted signal.

To achieve this objective, the optimization must adhere to several constraints. First, the power of the received signal must exceed a specified minimum threshold to ensure adequate signal quality. Additionally, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) should be maintained at a minimum of 10 dB to mitigate the effects of noise in the communication channel. The transmission delay is constrained to be no more than 5 milliseconds, reflecting the system's requirement for timely data delivery. Lastly, the noise variance introduced by the receiver must not exceed 0.5 to maintain acceptable performance levels.

### Variable Parameters
- Signal Power: The minimum signal power must be set at 0.1 watts.
- SNR: A minimum SNR of 10 dB is required.
- Delay: The maximum allowable delay for signal transmission is fixed at 5 milliseconds.
- Noise Variance: The maximum noise variance for the receiver is set at 0.5.
