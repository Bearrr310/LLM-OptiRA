### **Joint Routing and Power Control for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)**

### Problem Description:

WSNs consist of battery-powered nodes that collect and transmit data. The challenge is to design an energy-efficient routing and power control strategy.

**Objective:** Maximize network lifetime while ensuring data reliability.

**Constraints:**

1. The total energy consumed per transmission must remain within the battery capacity.
2. Each sensor node must forward packets to the sink while minimizing power usage.
3. The selected routing path must minimize the overall transmission delay.

### Variable Parameters:

- Number of sensor nodes: 30
- Maximum power per transmission: 5 dBm
- Battery capacity per node: 5000 mJ
- Network coverage radius: 500m
