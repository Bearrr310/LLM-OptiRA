### **Sum Energy Efficiency under Device Hardware Nonlinearity**

**Problem Description**  
In an IoT uplink scenario, each device transmits to a base station. The hardware of each device is nonlinear, causing its **power consumption to grow quadratically** with transmit power. The objective is to maximize the **sum energy efficiency**, i.e., \(\sum_i \frac{R_i}{a_i P_i^2 + b_i P_i + c_i}\), where \(R_i\) is the rate. The resulting fractional objective with quadratic denominators makes the problem non-convex.

**Variable Parameters**  
1. **Number of Devices**: 5  
2. **Max Transmit Power**: 2 W per device  
3. **Hardware Parameters**: \(a_i = 0.05, b_i = 0.1, c_i = 0.05\)  
4. **Channel Gain**: [0.4, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.8]  
5. **Noise Power**: \(5 \times 10^{-10}\) W  
6. **Bandwidth**: 500 kHz
