### **Coverage Optimization in mmWave Cellular Networks**

### Problem Description:

Millimeter-wave (mmWave) networks provide high data rates but suffer from severe path loss and blockages. The goal is to optimize beamforming and cell deployment to maximize coverage.

**Objective:** Maximize the number of covered users while maintaining high throughput.

**Constraints:**

1. The beamforming gain must compensate for mmWave path loss.
2. Each base station must not exceed its transmission power budget.
3. The number of active base stations must be minimized to save energy.

### Variable Parameters:

- Number of base stations: 5
- Carrier frequency: 28 GHz
- Maximum base station transmit power: 35 dBm
- Minimum received power for coverage: -80 dBm
