### **Fair Resource Allocation in Wireless Mesh Networks**

### Problem Description:

Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) rely on multiple nodes for decentralized communication. The challenge is to allocate bandwidth fairly among users to maximize network performance while preventing congestion.

**Objective:** Maximize network-wide throughput while ensuring fairness in bandwidth allocation.

**Constraints:**

1. The sum of allocated bandwidth across all users must not exceed the total available bandwidth.
2. Each user must receive a minimum guaranteed bandwidth.
3. The signal interference across adjacent links must remain below a threshold.

### Variable Parameters:

- Number of mesh nodes: 10
- Total available bandwidth: 50 MHz
- Minimum guaranteed bandwidth per user: 1 Mbps
- Maximum interference level: -95 dBm
