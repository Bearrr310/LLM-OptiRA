### **Joint Power and Subcarrier Allocation in OFDMA Networks**

### Problem Description:

Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) enables flexible resource allocation by assigning subcarriers to users. The goal is to allocate power and subcarriers efficiently to maximize network performance.

**Objective:** Maximize the overall system throughput.

**Constraints:**

1. Each subcarrier can be assigned to only one user.
2. The total transmit power must not exceed the available power budget.
3. The minimum SINR for each user must be satisfied.

### Variable Parameters:

- Number of users: 8
- Number of available subcarriers: 32
- Total transmit power: 40 dBm
- Minimum SINR requirement: 10 dB
