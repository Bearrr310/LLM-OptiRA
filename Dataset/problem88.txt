### **Load Balancing in 5G Ultra-Dense Networks**

### Problem Description:

In ultra-dense networks (UDNs), users should be efficiently distributed among multiple small cells to prevent congestion and optimize network performance.

**Objective:** Minimize the load variance across base stations to achieve load balancing.

**Constraints:**

1. Each user must be assigned to exactly one base station.
2. The number of users per small cell must not exceed its capacity.
3. The signal quality at each user must be above a minimum SINR threshold.

### Variable Parameters:

- Number of small cells: 10
- Number of users: 50
- Maximum users per small cell: 10
- Minimum SINR per user: 7 dB
