### **Joint User Scheduling and Power Allocation in NOMA Systems**

### Problem Description:

Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) enables multiple users to share the same frequency resources, requiring careful power allocation to maintain fairness.

**Objective:** Maximize sum rate while ensuring fairness among NOMA users.

**Constraints:**

1. The power allocated to each user must not exceed the base stationâ€™s maximum transmission power.
2. The difference in power levels between users must satisfy the SIC decoding condition.
3. Each user must achieve a minimum required data rate.

### Variable Parameters:

- Number of NOMA users: 6
- Base station power limit: 30 dBm
- Minimum data rate per user: 1 Mbps
- SIC decoding constraint: At least 6 dB difference between power levels
