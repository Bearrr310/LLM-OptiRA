### **Handover Optimization in High-Speed Rail Networks**

### **Problem Description:**

High-speed trains frequently switch between base stations, causing handover failures. The goal is to optimize the handover strategy.

**Objective:** Minimize the number of handovers while ensuring seamless connectivity.

**Constraints:**

1. Each user must be associated with one base station at a time.
2. The signal strength must not drop below a threshold.

**Variable Parameters:**

- Train speed: 300 km/h
- Number of base stations along the track: 10
- Minimum received signal power: -80 dBm
- Maximum handover delay: 50 ms
