### **UAV Deployment Optimization for Emergency Communication**

### Problem Description:

In disaster scenarios, UAVs provide emergency communication coverage. The goal is to deploy UAVs optimally to maximize network coverage.

**Objective:** Minimize the total number of UAVs while covering all affected areas.

**Constraints:**

1. Each UAV must cover a predefined minimum number of users.
2. The SINR at each user must be above a threshold.
3. UAVs must remain within a given altitude range.

### Variable Parameters:

- Number of potential UAV deployment locations: 15
- Minimum coverage per UAV: 20 users
- Minimum SINR per user: 8 dB
- UAV altitude range: 100m - 500m
