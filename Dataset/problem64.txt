### **Beamforming Optimization in Massive MIMO Systems**

### Problem Description:

Massive MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) employs a large number of antennas to enhance spatial diversity and spectral efficiency. The goal is to design an optimal beamforming strategy that maximizes the sum rate while ensuring fairness among users.

**Objective:** Maximize the total system throughput by optimizing beamforming vectors.

**Constraints:**

1. Each user must achieve a minimum SINR requirement for reliable reception.
2. The total transmit power across all antennas must not exceed the base stationâ€™s power budget.
3. Beamforming vectors must satisfy unit-norm constraints to maintain transmission quality.

### Variable Parameters:

- Number of antennas at the base station: 64
- Number of users: 16
- Maximum base station power: 40 dBm
- Minimum SINR per user: 12 dB
- Carrier frequency: 3.5 GHz
