### **Secure Communication in Wireless Networks Using Artificial Noise**

### Problem Description:

To enhance security, artificial noise (AN) can be used to interfere with eavesdroppers while maintaining communication quality for legitimate users.

**Objective:** Maximize the secrecy rate by optimizing artificial noise power allocation.

**Constraints:**

1. The total artificial noise power must not exceed a given limit.
2. The legitimate user’s SINR must be greater than a threshold.
3. The eavesdropper’s received SINR must be minimized.

### Variable Parameters:

- Number of legitimate users: 4
- Number of eavesdroppers: 2
- Maximum artificial noise power: 20 dBm
- Minimum SINR for legitimate users: 15 dB
