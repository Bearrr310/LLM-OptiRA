### **Dynamic Spectrum Access for Cognitive Radio Networks**

### Problem Description:

Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) allow secondary users (SUs) to opportunistically access the spectrum of primary users (PUs) without causing harmful interference. The challenge is to allocate spectrum dynamically while ensuring that PU transmissions remain protected.

**Objective:** Maximize the total throughput of secondary users while keeping interference to primary users below a threshold.

**Constraints:**

1. The interference caused by secondary users must not exceed a predefined limit.
2. Each secondary user can access at most one channel at a time.
3. The total power of each secondary user must remain within its maximum limit.

### Variable Parameters:

- Number of primary users: 4
- Number of secondary users: 8
- Available spectrum channels: 6
- Maximum transmit power per secondary user: 20 dBm
- Interference threshold to primary users: -90 dBm
