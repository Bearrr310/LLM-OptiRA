### **mmWave Beam Alignment Optimization**

### **Problem Description:**

In mmWave networks, beam alignment is crucial for maximizing throughput due to the high directionality of signals.

**Objective:** Minimize the beam misalignment probability while maintaining high link quality.

**Constraints:**

1. Each user must be assigned to one beam.
2. The received power at each user must be above a threshold.

**Variable Parameters:**

- Number of beams per base station: 8
- Number of users: 16
- Beam misalignment tolerance: 5Â°
- Minimum received power: -70 dBm
