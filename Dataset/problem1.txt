### Problem Description 
In this optimization problem, we aim to maximize the overall network throughput in a multi-user communication system characterized by multiple users sharing a wireless channel. The communication relies on a time-division multiple access (TDMA) scheme, with each user transmitting their data in distinct time slots. We model the channel between users and the base station using a **Rayleigh fading model**, which is suitable for urban environments with multiple scattering paths. The channel gain between user \(i\) and the base station is represented as \(h_{ii} \sim \mathcal{CN}(0, \sigma^2)\), where \(\sigma^2\) is determined by the average received power.
The objective function focuses on maximizing the sum of the logarithmic throughput for all users, achieved by optimizing the power allocation across users while considering the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). The optimization must satisfy several constraints:

1. Each user has a minimum rate requirement that must be met.
2. The power allocated to each user cannot exceed a specified maximum power limit.
3. The interference experienced by any user from others must remain below a predefined threshold to ensure acceptable service quality.
4. The total power used by all users combined must not surpass the overall power budget allocated for the system.

### Variable Parameters 

- **User Count:** There are **10 users** in the network.
- **Minimum Rate Requirement:** Each user requires a minimum data rate of **1 Mbps**.
- **Maximum Power Limit:** The maximum transmit power for each user is set at **30 mW**.
- **Interference Threshold:** The maximum allowable interference for any user is **10 mW**.
- **Total Power Budget:** The total available power for the system is capped at **300 mW**.
- **Noise Power:** The noise power in the system is considered to be **1 mW**.
- **Rayleigh Fading Variance:** The variance of the Rayleigh fading channel is set to \(\sigma^2 = 0.1\) (mW), reflecting a moderate urban environment.
