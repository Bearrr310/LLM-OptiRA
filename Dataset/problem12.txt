### 5G Resource Block Allocation
**Problem Background**:
In 5G networks, efficient resource block allocation is essential for maximizing user satisfaction. The optimization problem involves effectively allocating resource blocks while managing interference and meeting quality of service requirements.

**Channel Conditions**:
The channel gain for user \( i \) on resource block \( k \) is defined as:
\[
h_{ik} = \frac{P_t}{d_k^n} \cdot \delta_{ik}
\]
where \( P_t = 0.1 \) W (transmitted power), \( d_k \) is the distance to user \( i \) on resource block \( k \), \( n = 2 \) (path loss exponent), and \( \delta_{ik} \) is a small-scale fading factor with a maximum value of 1.
**Specific Parameters**:
- Number of users: 6
- Number of resource blocks: 20
- Minimum data rate requirement per user: 2 Mbps
- Maximum transmit power per user: 0.1 W
- Noise power: 0.01 W
- Distances to users: user 1: 30 m, user 2: 50 m, user 3: 70 m, user 4: 90 m, user 5: 110 m, user 6: 130 m.
