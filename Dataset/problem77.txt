### **User Association Optimization in Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets)**

### Problem Description:

HetNets consist of macro, pico, and femtocells, requiring intelligent user association strategies to balance load and improve performance.

**Objective:** Maximize network-wide throughput while ensuring balanced user distribution.

**Constraints:**

1. Each user must be assigned to one and only one base station.
2. The number of users per base station must not exceed its capacity.
3. The signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) per user must meet a minimum threshold.

### Variable Parameters:

- Number of macro base stations: 3
- Number of pico/femto base stations: 10
- Total number of users: 100
- Minimum SINR per user: 9 dB
