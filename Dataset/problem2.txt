### Problem Description
In this optimization problem, we focus on maximizing the overall network throughput in a multi-user communication system using a **multi-carrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA)** scheme. Each user transmits their data over multiple orthogonal codes, and the channel is modeled using a **Rician fading model**, suitable for environments where a strong line-of-sight (LOS) path exists alongside scattered paths. The channel gain between user \(i\) and the base station is given by \(h_{ii} \sim \mathcal{CN}(\sqrt{K}, 1)\), where \(K\) represents the Rician factor, indicating the strength of the LOS component.
The objective function aims to maximize the sum of the logarithmic throughput across all users, achieved by optimizing the power allocation for each user while accounting for the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). The optimization must satisfy the following constraints:
1. Each user has a minimum data rate requirement that must be satisfied.
2. The power allocated to each user cannot exceed a specified maximum power limit.
3. The interference experienced by any user from others must remain below a specified threshold to maintain service quality.
4. The total power utilized by all users combined must not exceed the overall power budget allocated for the system.

### Variable Parameters
- **User Count:** There are **8 users** in the network.
- **Minimum Rate Requirement:** Each user requires a minimum data rate of **1.5 Mbps**.
- **Maximum Power Limit:** The maximum transmit power for each user is set at **40 mW**.
- **Interference Threshold:** The maximum allowable interference for any user is **12 mW**.
- **Total Power Budget:** The total available power for the system is capped at **320 mW**.
- **Noise Power:** The noise power in the system is considered to be **2 mW**.
- **Rician Factor:** The Rician factor is set to \(K = 5\), indicating a strong line-of-sight component relative to the scattered paths.
