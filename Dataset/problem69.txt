### **User-Centric Cell-Free Massive MIMO for Next-Gen Networks**

### Problem Description:

Cell-free massive MIMO eliminates traditional cell boundaries, where multiple access points jointly serve users. The challenge is to allocate resources dynamically to optimize throughput while minimizing inter-user interference.

**Objective:** Maximize user-centric throughput by dynamically assigning access points and power.

**Constraints:**

1. Each user must be served by at least three access points for diversity gain.
2. The sum power across all access points must remain within a system-wide budget.
3. Each userâ€™s SINR must meet a minimum threshold for acceptable service quality.

### Variable Parameters:

- Number of distributed access points: 20
- Number of users: 30
- Maximum total system power: 50 dBm
- Minimum SINR per user: 10 dB
