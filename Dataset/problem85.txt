### **Relay Selection and Power Control in Cooperative Communication**

### Problem Description:

Cooperative communication enhances coverage by using relays to forward signals. The challenge is to select optimal relays and allocate power to maximize end-to-end data rates.

**Objective:** Maximize the achievable data rate while minimizing total power consumption.

**Constraints:**

1. Each user can be served by at most one relay.
2. The total power allocated to each relay must not exceed its power budget.
3. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the destination must meet a minimum threshold.

### Variable Parameters:

- Number of users: 6
- Number of available relays: 4
- Maximum relay transmit power: 23 dBm
- Minimum SNR at the destination: 12 dB
