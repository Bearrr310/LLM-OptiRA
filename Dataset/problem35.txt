### **Dynamic Backhaul Capacity Allocation in 5G Networks**

### Problem Description:

In 5G networks, limited backhaul capacity can become a bottleneck, requiring dynamic allocation strategies.

**Objective:** Minimize congestion while maximizing data flow efficiency.

**Constraints:**

1. The total allocated backhaul capacity must not exceed the available bandwidth.
2. Each base station must receive a minimum guaranteed backhaul capacity.
3. The network must dynamically adjust allocation based on real-time traffic demand.

### Variable Parameters:

- Number of base stations: 8
- Total backhaul capacity: 10 Gbps
- Minimum backhaul per base station: 500 Mbps
- Maximum per-user data rate: 100 Mbps
