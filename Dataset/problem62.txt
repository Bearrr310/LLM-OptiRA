### **Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation in IoT Networks**

### Problem Description:

In large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) networks, devices operate on limited battery power, making energy-efficient communication crucial. The goal is to optimize power control and time allocation to extend network lifetime while maintaining reliable communication.

**Objective:** Minimize total energy consumption while ensuring sufficient data transmission for all IoT devices.

**Constraints:**

1. Each IoT device must receive enough time slots to complete data transmission.
2. The total transmission power across all IoT devices must remain within an energy budget.
3. The minimum data rate for critical IoT applications must be met.

### Variable Parameters:

- Number of IoT devices: 100
- Maximum transmission power per device: 10 dBm
- Minimum data rate per device: 100 kbps
- Total energy budget: 500 mJ
