### **UAV-Assisted 5G Network for Disaster Recovery**

### Problem Description:

After a natural disaster, terrestrial base stations may be damaged. UAVs can be deployed as temporary base stations to restore connectivity. The challenge is to optimize UAV deployment and power control.

**Objective:** Maximize the number of covered users while minimizing UAV power consumption.

**Constraints:**

1. Each UAV must maintain a certain altitude to ensure signal coverage.
2. The total power consumed by UAVs must not exceed their energy budget.
3. Each user must receive a minimum SINR for a stable connection.

### Variable Parameters:

- Number of UAVs: 3
- Maximum UAV altitude: 300m
- Maximum UAV transmit power: 25 dBm
- Minimum SINR per user: 8 dB
- Number of ground users: 50
