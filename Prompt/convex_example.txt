### Mathematical Formulation: Rate Maximization in SISO Systems

### Objective Function

The goal is to maximize the total data transmission rate across all users:

\[
\max_{p, \alpha} \sum_{i} \log\left(1 + \frac{|h_{ii}|^2 p_i}{\sum_{j \neq i} |h_{ij}|^2 p_j + \sigma^2}\right)
\]

where:

- \( p_i \): Transmission power allocated to user \( i \) (continuous).
- \( h_{ii} \): Channel gain for the intended link of user \( i \).
- \( h_{ij} \): Channel gain from user \( j \) to user \( i \) (continuous).
- \( \sigma^2 \): Noise power.

### Constraints

1. **Power Constraints**:
    - Individual user power limits:
    \[
    0 \leq p_i \leq P_{\text{max}}, \quad \forall i
    \]
    - Total power budget:
    \[
    \sum_{i} p_i \leq P_{\text{total}}
    \]
2. **SINR Constraints**:
    - Each user must satisfy the minimum SINR requirement:
    \[
    \frac{|h_{ii}|^2 p_i}{\sum_{j \neq i} |h_{ij}|^2 p_j + \sigma^2} \geq \gamma_{\text{min}}, \quad \forall i
    \]
3. **Resource Allocation Constraints**:
    - Each user can only occupy one subcarrier or time slot:
    \[
    \alpha_{ik} \in \{0, 1\}, \quad \forall i, \quad \sum_{k} \alpha_{ik} = 1
    \]

### Additional Variable Definitions

1. **Channel Gain Definitions**:
    - **Path Loss**: \( L(d) \), which can be expressed as:
    \[
    L(d) = L_0 + 10n \log_{10}\left(\frac{d}{d_0}\right)
    \]
    where \( L_0 \) is the reference path loss at distance \( d_0 \), \( n \) is the path loss exponent, and \( d \) is the distance between the transmitter and receiver.
    - **Fading Model**: The channel gains can be modeled as:
    \[
    h_{ii} = \sqrt{g_{ii}} L(d_{ii})
    \]
    \[
    h_{ij} = \sqrt{g_{ij}} L(d_{ij})
    \]
    where \( g_{ii} \) and \( g_{ij} \) are random variables representing small-scale fading (e.g., Rayleigh fading), typically modeled as complex Gaussian variables.

### Identification of Non-Convex Parts

The optimization problem presented contains several non-convex components due to the following:

1. **Logarithmic Function**: The objective function includes a logarithmic term, which is concave, but the overall maximization creates a non-convex problem.
2. **SINR Constraints**: The SINR constraints can also introduce non-convexity because they involve ratios of quadratic forms.
3. **Binary Variables**: The use of binary variables \(\alpha_{ik}\) creates a mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem, which is generally non-convex.

### Convexification Approach

To address the non-convexities, the following strategies can be employed:

1. **Change of Variables**: Introduce auxiliary variables to reformulate the SINR constraints into a convex form.
2. **Logarithm Reformulation**: Convert the logarithmic objective to a form suitable for optimization.
3. **Relaxation of Binary Variables**: Use continuous relaxation for binary variables where appropriate.

### Derivation for Convexification

1. **Logarithmic Objective Reformulation**:
Let \( z_i = \frac{|h_{ii}|^2 p_i}{\sum_{j \neq i} |h_{ij}|^2 p_j + \sigma^2} \). Instead of maximizing \( \log(1 + z_i) \), we can maximize \( z_i \) directly under certain transformations.
2. **SINR Constraints**:
To make the SINR constraints convex, we can rewrite:
\[
|h_{ii}|^2 p_i \geq \gamma_{\text{min}} \left( \sum_{j \neq i} |h_{ij}|^2 p_j + \sigma^2 \right)
\]
This can be treated as a convex constraint by rearranging terms to isolate \( p_i \).
3. **Relaxation of Binary Variables**:
Instead of using binary variables \( \alpha_{ik} \), introduce continuous variables \( 0 \leq \alpha_{ik} \leq 1 \) such that:
\[
\sum_{k} \alpha_{ik} = 1 \quad \forall i
\]

### Convex Optimization Problem

After applying these transformations, the new optimization problem can be expressed as follows:

### Objective Function

Maximize:

\[
\max_{p, \alpha} \sum_{i} z_i
\]

where \( z_i \) is defined as:

\[
z_i = \frac{|h_{ii}|^2 p_i}{\sum_{j \neq i} |h_{ij}|^2 p_j + \sigma^2}
\]

### Constraints

1. **Power Constraints**:
\[
0 \leq p_i \leq P_{\text{max}}, \quad \forall i
\]
\[
\sum_{i} p_i \leq P_{\text{total}}
\]
2. **Convex SINR Constraints**:
\[
|h_{ii}|^2 p_i \geq \gamma_{\text{min}} \left( \sum_{j \neq i} |h_{ij}|^2 p_j + \sigma^2 \right), \quad \forall i
\]
3. **Relaxed Resource Allocation**:
\[
0 \leq \alpha_{ik} \leq 1, \quad \forall i, k
\]
\[
\sum_{k} \alpha_{ik} = 1, \quad \forall i
\]

### Supplementary Variables

- **Channel Gains**:
    - The channel gains can still be defined as:
    \[
    h_{ii} = \sqrt{g_{ii}} L(d_{ii}), \quad h_{ij} = \sqrt{g_{ij}} L(d_{ij})
    \]

This reformulated optimization problem is now in a convex form and can be directly addressed using standard convex optimization solvers, allowing for efficient computation and resource allocation in the SISO system.
