To construct a complete mathematical formula for an optimization problem based on the input details provided and general knowledge of optimization problems, we can start by defining the objective function and constraints clearly.

### Optimization Problem:
**Objective Function**: We want to optimize the total throughput (Z) in a communication system represented as:
\[
Z = \sum_{i=1}^{N} R_i
\]
where:
- \( R_i \) is the throughput of user \( i \),
- \( N \) is the total number of users.

The throughput \( R_i \) can be modeled based on the Shannon capacity formula as follows:
\[
R_i = B \log_2(1 + \frac{P_i h_i}{N_0 B})
\]
where:
- \( B \) is the bandwidth,
- \( P_i \) is the transmitted power for user \( i \),
- \( h_i \) is the channel condition for user \( i \),
- \( N_0 \) is the noise power spectral density.

### Objective:
We want to **maximize** the total throughput \( Z \).
\[
\text{Objective: Maximize } Z
\]
[Optimization Flag: 1]

### Constraints:
1. **Power Constraint** (total power available should not exceed the maximum power \( P_{max} \)):
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{N} P_i \leq P_{max}
\]

2. **Resource Allocation Constraint** (each user must operate within a certain signal-to-noise ratio):
\[
\frac{P_i h_i}{N_0 B} \leq S_i \quad \forall i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, N\}
\]
where \( S_i \) is the maximum allowable signal-to-noise ratio for user \( i \).

3. **Non-negativity Constraint**:
\[
P_i \geq 0 \quad \forall i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, N\}
\]

### Formulas for Additional Variables:
- **Channel Condition \( h_i \)**: 
In a typical model, the channel condition for user \( i \) can be expressed in terms of distance \( d_i \) and path loss \( \alpha \):
\[
h_i = \frac{G_t G_r}{d_i^\alpha}
\]
where:
- \( G_t \) and \( G_r \) are the gains at the transmitter and receiver, respectively,
- \( d_i \) is the distance between user \( i \) and the base station,
- \( \alpha \) is the path loss exponent.

- **Total Power Constraint**:
Define \( P_{max} \) as the maximum power that can be allocated:
\[
P_{max} \text{ is a constant representing the total available power.}
\]

### Final Formulation:
The complete mathematical formulation of this optimization problem is:

- **Maximize Throughput**:
\[
Z = \sum_{i=1}^{N} B \log_2(1 + \frac{P_i h_i}{N_0 B})
\]
- **Subject to**:
1. \(\sum_{i=1}^{N} P_i \leq P_{max}\)
2. \(\frac{P_i h_i}{N_0 B} \leq S_i \quad \forall i\)
3. \(P_i \geq 0 \quad \forall i\)

This formulation captures the essence of optimizing the throughput in a communication system with specified constraints.
